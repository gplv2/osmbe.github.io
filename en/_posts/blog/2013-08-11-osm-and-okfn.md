Our community, OpenStreetMap Belgium is going to collaborate with the Open Knowledge Foundation Belgium (OKFN Belgium). OSM BE will be part of OKFN BE as a working group. Ben Abelshausen will become member of the board of directors of OKFN Belgium - officially after the next general assembly in February 2013 - to help with representing the open knowledge scene in Belgium.

The OSM-community in Belgium has been pondering the question for a long time if we should have a legal entity to represent the community. OKFN BE gives us the perfect opportunity to set this up under the umbrella of a bigger organization. This will given us the tools to communicate better, to better promote OSM and even to get financial support for some basic operational needs (like this website).

The last couple of months there has been a huge growth in the activities of the OSM-community and the proposal of Pieter Colpaert to join OKFN was timed very well. Today we can announce that OSM BE functions as a working group withing OKFN BE.

Also OKFN is growing with this accouncements because they now help represent a new community that is reponsable for creating one the most important open data sets out there: OpenStreetMap.
